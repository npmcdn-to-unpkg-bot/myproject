1.1 - 31-Jan-2012   
   * [NEW] Added -loadValueForKey:fromDictionaryRepresentation: method.
   * [FIX] Default implementation of AMCKeysForDictionaryRepresentation returns complete set of all object's properties names, including properties declared by superclasses. ( Issue #15 )
   * [FIX] Added Log, Workaround ( when AMC_NO_THROW defined) & Exception ( when AMC_NO_THROW not defined) on possible KVC failure/bug (Issue #19).
   * [FIX] Fixed missed imports in NSObject+AutoMagicCoding.m, which may lead to inability to compile AMC as a part of libs (no compile error occurred, but AMC wasn't included in library).
